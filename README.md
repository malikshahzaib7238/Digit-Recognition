# Digit Recognition Project

## Overview

This project focuses on digit recognition using TensorFlow and offers two different approaches for achieving high accuracy:

- **Using Dense Layers:** Model is trained using dense layers, achieving a training accuracy of 98% and a test accuracy of 97%.

- **Using CNN Layers:** Model is trained using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers, achieving an impressive training accuracy of 99.5% and a test accuracy of 98.5%.

It aims to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

- `Using CNN`: Contains code related to digit recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks.
- `Using Dense`: Contains code related to digit recognition using Dense Neural Networks.
